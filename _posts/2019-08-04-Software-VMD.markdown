## What is [VMD](https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/) (Visual Molecular Dynamics)?
> VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting. VMD supports computers running MacOS X, Unix, or Windows, is distributed free of charge, and includes source code.

I have a series of tutorial about what is VMD and how to use VMD. If you are interested in these tutorials, you could see these tutorials at the WeChat Official Account which is named Quanutum Chemistry (量子化学). His QR Code is provided as below.

You can find the article about VMD at the directory of Tutorial on various softwares, such as Gaussian 16, VMD and so on.
